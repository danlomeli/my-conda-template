# Conda and pyenv
Combining Conda and pyenv can offer a flexible Python environment management solution, catering to different project needs or preferences. Here's a step-by-step tutorial on how to use Conda and pyenv together on an Ubuntu system that uses Python 3.8 as its default version, with the goal of using Python 3.9 for AI development.

### Step 1: Install pyenv

1. **Install Dependencies**: Before installing pyenv, you'll need to install some dependencies. Open a terminal and run:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install -y build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev \
   libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev \
   xz-utils tk-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev python-openssl git
   ```

2. **Install pyenv**: Use the curl command to install pyenv:
   ```bash
   curl https://pyenv.run | bash
   ```

3. **Configure Shell**: Add pyenv to your shell's startup file (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.) by appending the following lines:
   ```bash
   export PATH="$HOME/.pyenv/bin:$PATH"
   eval "$(pyenv init --path)"
   eval "$(pyenv virtualenv-init -)"
   ```

4. **Restart your Terminal** or run `source ~/.bashrc` (or the equivalent for your shell) to apply the changes.

### Step 2: Install Python 3.9 Using pyenv

1. **Install Python 3.9**: Once pyenv is installed, you can install Python 3.9 by running:
   ```bash
   pyenv install 3.9.7
   ```

2. **Set Python 3.9 as Local or Global Version**: To use Python 3.9 for a specific project, navigate to the project directory and run:
   ```bash
   pyenv local 3.9.7
   ```
   To set it globally (for all directories without a specific version set), run:
   ```bash
   pyenv global 3.9.7
   ```

### Step 3: Install Conda

1. **Download Anaconda or Miniconda**: Visit the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) website to find the command to download the installer script. For Miniconda, the command might look like:
   ```bash
   wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
   ```

2. **Run the Installer**: Run the downloaded script to install. For Miniconda, it would be:
   ```bash
   bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
   ```

3. **Follow the On-Screen Instructions**: Agree to the terms, and if you're unsure about any installation options, the defaults are typically safe.

### Step 4: Create a Conda Environment with Python 3.9

1. **Create a New Conda Environment**: You can create a new Conda environment specifying Python 3.9 like so:
   ```bash
   conda create --name ai_env python=3.9
   ```

2. **Activate the Conda Environment**: Once the environment is created, activate it with:
   ```bash
   conda activate ai_env
   ```

### Step 5: Install AI Libraries

With your Conda environment activated, you can now install AI and machine learning libraries using `conda` or `pip`.

```bash
conda install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
conda install pytorch torchvision -c pytorch
# or for TensorFlow
pip install tensorflow
```

### Conclusion

You now have a flexible setup with both pyenv managing different Python versions and Conda managing project-specific environments and dependencies. Remember to activate the correct pyenv version or Conda environment as needed for your projects. This setup maximizes compatibility and control, allowing you to work on various projects with different requirements efficiently.

Execute the following command to download and install Pyenv:

```bash
curl https://pyenv.run | bash
```

### Step 3: Set Up the Environment

To correctly configure Pyenv, add the following lines to your `~/.bashrc` or equivalent shell configuration file:

```bash
echo 'export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo -e 'if command -v pyenv 1>/dev/null 2>&1; then\n  eval "$(pyenv init -)"\nfi' >> ~/.bashrc
```

After adding these lines, restart your shell:

```bash
exec "$SHELL"
```

### Step 4: Verify the Installation

To ensure Pyenv is installed correctly, try installing a specific version of Python, such as 3.8.3:

```bash
pyenv install --list  # Lists available Python versions
pyenv install 3.8.3   # Install Python 3.8.3
```

To verify the installation, check the installed Python versions:

```bash
pyenv versions
```

Set Python 3.8.3 as the global version:

```bash
pyenv global 3.8.3
```

And verify by starting a Python shell:

```bash
python
```

### Useful Commands
